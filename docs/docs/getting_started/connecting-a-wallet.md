# Connecting a Wallet

Wallets commonly use a high polling interval for the transaction receipt. To be able to see the preconfirmation speed, we've modified Rabby to speed up that interval.

## Build and Install Modified Rabby Wallet

You can test it by compiling it:

```sh
make build-rabby
```

And importing it to your browser locally (see [Firefox](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/) or [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world?hl=es-419#load-unpacked) references). The compiled extension directory is `rabby/dist` for Google Chrome, and `rabby/dist-mv2` for Mozilla Firefox.

## Adding the devnet as a Rabby custom network

To access our devnet, you will need to add the network to your modified wallet.

To manually add the network, follow these steps:

1. Log into your Rabby wallet, click on the **More** button near the bottom right corner.

You can now use the wallet to interact with the Based-OP devnet. Read the section below to learn how to witness preconfirmations.
